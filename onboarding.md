# Guidelines to inquire an undergraduate research experience
- check out the group website and explore areas of research interest. There are always exciting research that needs to be done, especially with PNSN data!
- email me at mdenolle@uw.edu
- set up a in-person meeting
- read the "working contract"




# Guidelines to apply for a Ph.D.
- Contact in the fall before submission.
- Submit a piece of code you wrote, or an explanation of the contributions you made to a more extensive code
- Submit a short write up of what makes you passionate about earthquake sciences or seismology
- Apply with some foundations in either seismology, earthquake science, geophysics, computer sciences (e.g., coursework and at least one research internship on broadly speaking geophysics)
- A scientific major in undergraduate/master is required. If the student arrives without the foundations described above, he/she will be expected to take coursework in the graduate program and self-learn with textbooks.
- Provide a CV, research posters, internship reports, papers
- Be self-motivated. Ph.D. is a long journey, and you will be the main driver.
