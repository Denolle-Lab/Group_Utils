## Seismology in Practice

This page gathers the tutorials that the group has found useful to get started. This should help undergraduate researchers get started in seismology.


To undergraduate researchers: It is **essential** to become comfortable with Shell scripting, version control (GitHub), and some Python or Julia. Please go through the following courses from the Software Carpentry:

## Watch research seminars online
- [IRIS-SAGE/GAGE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGQwSTwiUcKwWZ9lhS2shpwMPwKSNl3Eo)


## Software and Editing Carpentries:
- [Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/): basic file and project management
- [Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/): code version control 
- [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/): coding fundamentals
- [Latex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes): Manuscript editing preferred scripting language
- [Jypyter Notebooks](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/jupyter-python/get-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python/): jupyter notebook introduction
- [Conda, Mamba, environment](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/conda-intro): nice intro from a biologist on the basics of conda, mamba, and creating a computing environment.


## Basic Seismology
- Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFwdjfiK4gk) of an introduction to Opbsy.
- Install Obspy using conda: ```conda install -c conda-forge obspy```
- [Reading seismograms](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/reading_seismograms.html)
- [Plot waveforms](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/waveform_plotting_tutorial.html)
- [Filter data](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/filtering_seismograms.html)
- [Spectrograms](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/plotting_spectrograms.html)
- [Focal mechanism](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/courses/oc410/reading/Focal_mechanism_primer.pdf)

## Intermediate Seismology
- [Practice downloading and plotting](https://krischer.github.io/seismo_live_build/html/ObsPy/07_Basic_Processing_Exercise_solution_wrapper.html)
- [Practice looking at earthquake](https://krischer.github.io/seismo_live_build/html/ObsPy/08_Exercise__2008_MtCarmel_Earthquake_and_Aftershock_Series_solution_wrapper.html)

A fantastic set of video tutorials by the ROSES program. Note that every year has slightly different topics.
