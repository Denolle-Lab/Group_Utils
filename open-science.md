## Project
- Each project should start with a github, an informative readme file, a main and a dev branch, both students/postdocs and me as contributors, continuous integration tools.
## Software: 
- Each code has to be commented on, tested, and reviewed by one group member (please try!).
- Test each of the functions to verify that they workâ€”present simple tests in a notebook with bits of data.
- Codes have to be tested on two different machines, with instructions on installing, running, and testing.
- Submit to your Github; the group Github should have the repository forked.
- Your code should be hosted on your own Github or on the group Github and has to be open source. We do not patent codes but make them freely available.
- When the group member leaves, the code should remain available to other group members.
- When software is worth a single publication, we will write a software paper with benchmark tests and examples and obtain a DOI for the code.
## Data
- The data we use will be available to the public. Keep in mind the DOI of where the data was stored.
- Data that is < 10GB has to be documented, packaged and distributed on open access archives such as zenodo and figshare by submitting the paper.
## Publication
- We will submit publication only to non-profit journals (AGU, SSA journals, EGU journals, AAAS journals)
- We will seek open-access whenever possible (i.e. submit to seismica!)
