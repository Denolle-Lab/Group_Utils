Group members are encouraged and will be supported to attend domestic and international conferences. Graduate student and postdocs may expect to go to 3-4 conferences a year. In-person meetings bring better networking opportunities than virtual meetings, and I will encourage travel when it is safe.


## Choice of a conference
- Group members should expect to attend AGU, SSA, SCEC
- Additional workshops such as summer schools and focused topics are also recommended.
- Group members are welcome to suggest other conferences. The group member and Marine will discuss the appropriate numbers of conferences and discuss the balance between work productivity and work dissemination


## Abstract submissions
- Use the google doc dedicated to writing abstracts to make edits
- Edit your abstract with: 1) conference session, 2) presentation title, 3) authors, 4) abstract.
- provide the abstract at least 1 week before deadline.

## Cost managements
Expect to use the departmental financial resource to pay in advance for your travel, and the occasional use of your personal card (followed by reimbursement)
a mix of departmental fund advances for travel and personal card + later reimbursement 

Keep all receipts, take photos, and save that into a folder on your computer.

## Practicing
Practicing is the most important step of public presentations. Group members have received multiple Student presentations awards in part because they were extremely well prepared.
Everyone (Marine included) should expect to practicate at least twice before presenting.
Group members are encouraged to present in front of other non-seismologist peers.


## Presentations
- Make a poster using Illustrator or Powerpoint or Google slides so that Marine can edit. Do not submit before Marine gets to view it. Contact other co-authors for review before printing/submitting.
- Make a oral presentation on Powerpoint or Google slides. Powerpoint has great recording tools, please record a video to practice and to keep a version to post on Youtube.
- **Tips for poster presentations**:
  - Prepare a two-min lightning presentation, recording this on a youtube video is very useful
  - Prepare 2 versions of your poster walk-through:
        * For non-specialist: 5 min chat that dilutes details, bigger impacts
        * For specialists: 15 min chat that spend times on the methods (the specialists know about the impact).


## Attending a conference
- Conferences serve two purposes: dissemination of your work and social networking. Withou in person, you remove the second but equally important element that early career members need.
- Email potential postdoc supervisor about your upcoming presentation, you may even suggest to meet afterwards. This is how Marine got jobs!
- Prepare an agenda of the session you want to attend. Be structured but be flexible for changes in your schedule.
- Social interactions in the evening are encouraged. Be wary that social events that include alcohol may lead to unwanted behavior, either on one's end, or on somebody else' end.
- Keep track of group members and see how everyone is doing.
