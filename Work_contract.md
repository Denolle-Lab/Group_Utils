# My philosophy
I welcome everyone in the group. My selection criteria are based mainly on the student motivation, passion for the field, and ability to learn new concepts. In particular, I expect students who are coming from prestigious universities to have high academic standards. For students coming from underserved backgrounds, I seek those demonstrating their ability to grasp new concepts and learn how to code. I actively pay attention to students coming from underrepresented groups.
My overall philosophy of advising is that students and postdocs should expect from me academic advising, career strategic planning, scientific communication advising, work&life balance discussions, 100% financial and computational support, and not the least, a friendship! And I am an optimist!




# Expectations during the PhD:
 ## 1. for Year 1 of Ph.D. (GS):
- I highly recommend starting research the summer before the program start date to 1) review literature, 2) set up computing tools, 3) get familiar with the data, 4) transition to grad school. This prep time may not be necessary if the prospective student already researched seismology somewhat related to the Ph.D. research.
- Pursue in parallel both coursework and research. Coursework is chosen to complement the skills and bring breadth.
- Research is expected to move forward with a bi-annual presentation to the research group: some literature review, some basic coding.
- If the research requires coding, the student can write her/his bit of core code with a simple dataset to show that the primary method is understood.
- GS can expect to reach out to me for technical and scientific discussion more frequently so that in later years. 
- GS should aim to submit Ph.D. fellowship applications to NSF (Fall of that year)
- Grades do not matter much to me, except for C+ and B- in easy quantitative classes where GS and I will discuss a plan of action to make sure these skills are learned.

## 2. Expectations for Year 2 of Ph.D. (GS):
- Limited coursework 
- Meet in October-November to brainstorm on the Ph.D. story.
- Submit quals plan by December: this should outline what you expect the Ph.D. story and its chapters should be.
- The research project is expected to come to a draft of publication by quals time.
- Summer post quals should be dedicated to the submission of the first paper. The paper should be submitted by the end of the summer.

## 3. Expectations for Year 3-4 of Ph.D. (GS):
- Work on the second project
- Almost zero or very limited coursework
- Expected submission of papers #2 and #3 or made substantial progress toward both of them.
- Prepare annual one meeting with committee members with a wrap-up of Y1-3 and plan for the following year.
- Talk with me about CV, research statements, postdoc opportunities, postdoc fellowships.
- Have your website always up to date.
- GS expected to help to teach two times. The time commitment to teaching duties should not impact research more, and students may not allocate more than one-course load.

## 4. Expectations for Year 5 of Ph.D. (GS):
- Expect to defend.
- Submit plan for the dissertation by October-November to discuss with me
- Submit the plan to finish up chapters/papers
- Defend!

# Academic activities for everyone:
- A typical year is between 2-4 conferences or workshops (AGU/SSA/SCEC/EGU or other domestic national meetings like SEG + workshop/summer school) that I will cover fully. Contact group admin for reservation and booking to avoid spending upfront. I follow Federal and UW guidelines for spending.
- GS/PR are expected to attend every weekly department colloquium seminar.
- GS/PR/US are expected to attend every geophysical seminar or seismolunch.
- GS/PR are expected to meet one-on-one with every speaker that the group invites.
- GS/PR/US are expected to attend the weekly group seminar and participate with at least one question per meeting and one presentation per semester.
- GS/PR expect to be offered opportunities to write proposals or grant to support research. This is purely voluntary! I recommend at least one chance during the Ph.D. and postdoc for the experience.
- If a recommended academic activity feels like too much work or a burden, the US/GS/PR is expected to communicate this in advance to me, and we can easily cancel attendance.
- GS/US/PR and I are expected to practice at least a one-time presentation in front of the group.
- GS/US/PR/I are expected to communicate on a weekly basis, except during vacation time.
